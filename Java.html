 <h2>1- <b>Java</b></h2>
<p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language with many capabilities,
 making it perfect for web-based development.<br>
 In Sun Microsystems (American company) Java was initially called Oak and built up in 1990 to add C++ language skills.<br>
 The WORA concept (Write Once Run Anywhere) was used in the development of Java.<br> 
 In 1995, the language became global and is now owned by Oracle.<br>
 It is specified by the programming language, a compilation processor, 
 a core library and a runtime (virtual Java machine).<br>
 Java runtime enables users to create code of programming in languages besides Java,
 if it is still running on the virtual machine.<br>
 The java platform has the following features:
1- Unique framework: java applications are relative to Java's virtual machine and
 do not have clear access to the operating system.<br>
   This renders extremely flexible java applications.<br>
2- Object-oriented programming language: All the components in Java are structures, 
with the exception of basic data types.<br>
3- Language that is  interpreted and assembled:Java source code is translated to a non-target application bytecode type.<br>
   The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets these Bytecode orders. The JVM includes a Hotspot-Compiler which 
   converts essential bytecode output orders for the native code.<br>
4- Instantaneous storage devices: 
Java handles the assignment and decomposition of memory in order to create new structures.<br>
   The software has no immediate memory control.
   A so-called trash collector immediately erases components at which no useful link takes place.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
<tr><ol>
   <p><td><li>Java code operates on all machines, but it requires JVM to be installed on the device, 
   and no specific Software else is needed to be downloaded.</li>
	<li>Java can be easily used, written, modified, debugged and studied.</li>
	<li>Java Features many machines operating together on the same network. 
	It enhances network applications which add to the accessibility of both data and applications.</li>
	<li>In Java, the memory is separated into two sections: heap and stack. 
	If a JVM variable is declared, it provides memory from either stack or heap space. This aims to preserve and recover knowledge quickly.</p>
    <td><li>Just as Python, java uses alot from the memory and is considerably slower than interpreted languages.</li>
	<li>It reduces application efficiency while the garbage collector program in Java is running. 
	It is because all the other scripts in the garbage collector script must be interrupted to enable it to operate.</li>
<li>The standard appearance of Graphic User Interface (GUI) applications that are compiled with the Swing toolkit in Java is very different 
from classical applications.</li>
	<li>It reduces application efficiency while the garbage collector program in Java is running. 
	It is because all the other scripts in the garbage collector script must be interrupted to enable it to operate.</li></td>
