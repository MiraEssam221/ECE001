<h2>2- <b>C++</b></h2>
<p>C++ is the middle-level programming language of a common purpose, orientated object,
and a C language derivative that allows C++ to be translated into a 'C' format.<br>
Some scenarios can render C++ an example of a hybrid language.<br>
C++ has been developed to build simple,
flexible code to help maintain major development projects while presenting high-level abstractions.<br>
C++ is a strong programming language for the general purpose. It can be utilized to produce OS, browsers, games, etc.<br>
C++ supports various programming approaches such as sequential, object-oriented, interactive etc.
 This keeps C++ both solid and versatile.<br>
The highlight of C++ is mainly due to the fact that the language is visual basic.<br>
How an element is different from previous forms of programming.
 C++ is built to assist the programmer to do what they like.<br>
This also indicates, conversely, that the language mostly won't prevent you from doing things that don't make sense, 
as it'll presume you 're doing that for some purpose it doesn't recognize.<br>
There are a lot of vulnerabilities in novice programmers if found unknowingly.<br>
It is one of the main factors why it is just as necessary to learn what you shouldn't be doing with C++,
as to learn what to do.</p>

   <p><td><li></li>
	<li>C++ is a programming language with different paradigms. "Paradigm" relates to the programming type. 
	It comprises the software's logic, design and process. 
	Three paradigms of C++ are standardized, fundamental and object-oriented.</li>
	<li>C++ is a procedure language strongly linked to the language of the computer,
	it permits the low level controlling of information at a specific  level.
	C++ is used to build integrated systems and compilers.</li>
	<li>C++ provides the programmer with full memory management ability.</li></p>
    <td><li>The C++ pointers are a comparably hard subject and require lots of memory. 
	Misappropriation of pointers such as wild pointers can malfunction or cause the system to be abnormal.</li>
	<li>There are still specific security problems because friend operations, global variables and,
	pointers are available.</li>
<li>C++ needs to develop a garbage collector option to remove unwanted data immediately.</li></td>
