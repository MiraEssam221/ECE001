<h2>3- <b>Python</b></h2>
<p>Python is a complex, object-oriented programming language based on versatile and powerful functionality.<br>
It was built at CWI in the Netherlands in the 1980's and published for the first time in 1991.<br>
Python can act as a coding or glue language swiftly for integrate systems.<br> 
This is also suitable for designing the Rapid Application Develop(RAD) software.<br>
Python is a (bytecode-compiled) flexible, programming language. No variable, input, process or procedure types are declared in the source code.<br>
This keeps the code simple and quick, and the testing of the source code compilation time is lost.
<br> Python monitors all sorts of runtime variables and flags of code that cause error while running.
It's simple for inputs and users to work on.<br> In addition, if the code is attempting to read a parameter which is not an identified value,
 the processor produces or creates a runtime error in Python.<br>  Python is case-sensitive so that "a" or "A" isn't similar. 
The ending of a line represents the completion of a phrase, at the end of a statement Python doesn't need a semicolon.
<br> Statements start with "#" and continue to the end.<br>
An unusual feature of Python is that a coding piece's whitespace influences its meaning.<br>
 The same coding should be set by the indentation of their relative component or if or anything else, 
 as part of the reasonable chain of statements, such as those that forms the mechanism.<br> When one of the lines in a category has a distinct indentation,
 a syntax error is marked.</p>

<h3><b>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of Python Language:</b></h3>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
<tr><ol>
   <p><td><li>Provides easy-to-understand script, simple configuration, and web creation with several useful applications.</li>
	<li>Pythonon is an interpreted language, for it converts your code base into a middle bytecode type<br> 
	then transforms it into your particular computer's main language, and then execute it.</li>
	<li>Python is easy to implement with languages such as  C++, JAVA etc.</li>
	<li>Python can also run in Windows , Linux , Unix, Macintosh, etc on several operating systems.<br> 
	For example If a Python program was written  on a Macintosh computer ,so it will run on a mac os system and vice versa,
	therefore  Python is considered to be a portable language.</p>
    <td><li>Python is slow in processing</li>
	<li>Python is not a very great language for android development. it is seen as a poor language for smart devices development.</li>
<li>For memory-intensive processes Python is not a good option. Python consumes the memory  because of the variety of data kinds.</li>
	<li>The access layer for the Python database is considered for being slightly underdeveloped and limited.</li>
	<li>Due to the dynamically typed language, further tests should be conducted and contains  errors that occur only during runtime.</li></td>
