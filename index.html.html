<p> This is the main page for introduction about Programming Languages.<br>
 First of all, what does programming mean?<br>
Programming is an algorithm which is taken to be encoded into the programming language to be performed via a computer.<br>
 Having  a solution is an important main step towards programming.<br>
 Algorithms define the solutions to an issue in terms of the information needed to evaluate the instances of the issue and 
 the series of stages required to achieve the expected outcomes.<br> 
 The programming languages must contain an overview of the project as well as,
 the results,as languages have control structures and different data for this purpose.<br>
 Computer programming languages support us in sending orders to a computer in a syntax the machine acknowledges.<br>
 Like many human languages do, therefore, programmers can interact with a computer by a number of computer programming languages.<br>
 Every language, from C Language to Python, has its unique distinctive properties, although there are often commonalities among programming languages.<br>
 The programming language is often named the binary language, although it is also labeled the 'compiling' language.<br>
 These languages enable computers to handle broad and complicated data swathes accurately and effectively.<br>
 In today's environment there are plenty of languages of programming.<br></p>
 The three most significant, appropriate and requested languages have been summarized in the next pages.<br></p>
